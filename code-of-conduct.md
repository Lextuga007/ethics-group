# Code of Conduct

[AphA (Association of Professional Healthcare Analysts)](https://www.aphanalysts.org/) are committed to the Ethics Group being a space where people feel welcome to discuss and share their thoughts and ideas. Whilst AphA have a professional [Code of Conduct for Professional Analytics Competence](https://www.aphanalysts.org/code-of-conduct/), it is expanded here for the Ethics Group to ensure that those participating are protected from abuse, harassment or discrimination, and that the discussions we have are supportive and productive.

This Code of Conduct (CoC) is inspired and based upon the [RMarkdown's Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html) which in turn has been based on other organisations' CoCs. 

If you would like to suggest an addition or amendment then you can make an issue, submit a PR, or use the [AphA contact form](https://www.aphanalysts.org/contact-apha/).

By "Community" we refer to those involved in these ethics group but also, by extension, any person who these discussions relate to such as other analysts, data scientists or statisticians, people whose work includes analysis and those whose data we work with such as patients and service users.

# Our Pledge

We, attenders to this group, pledge to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, class, job banding, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, 
and healthy community.

# Our Standards
